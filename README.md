## How to use
The app is very easy to use. Start the app with Node then follow the prompts to add, update, or view records of employees.

## Languages and Lessons
The exercises in this project focussed on learning SQL, I also took the opportunity to increase my understanding of promises and converted the callback based query functions to promises to help me use the results of those queries as Inquirer prompts.

## How to contribute
If anyone would like to improve the app by contributing, they're welcome to submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/keiththarp/staff-stats-displayer).
